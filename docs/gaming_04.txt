In this video, I'll teach you six teamfighting rules you must always follow as a carry — including one special rule at the end that answers the popular question: when to farm or fight. These tips are what I use personally and also teach to my students to teamfight like Immortal players — with great results.

If you want to learn more tips like this, I provide one-to-one coaching to players looking to improve in Dota 2. You can check out my website in the description box down below. With that said, let's get into the video.

Rule #1: Never frontline without information
The first and most important rule when it comes to teamfighting is to not show yourself if your threats aren’t showing. In every game, there are heroes that pose big danger to you, and others that do not. At every point in the game, you need to identify who the ones are that can disable or chain-stun you before fights happen.

For example, dangerous heroes with Blink stuns or disables — like Lion and Axe — or spells that render you completely useless, like Chronosphere or Black Hole. As long as these heroes aren’t showing, it’s generally a good idea to wait until they appear and cast their spells before you jump into the fight.

Learn to use your teammates as a shield for information and pair that with good map awareness. This will definitely win you more fights in the long run. As the saying goes, patience is king in teamfighting.

Rule #2: Get Aegis before fighting or pushing
Aegis is one of the most important factors when it comes to closing out games and not throwing in teamfights or pushes. You should always signal your teammates to take Roshan after lanes are pushed out or pickoffs are made.

The first Roshan attempt is usually within 20 to 30 minutes, which will start the first high ground push or big teamfight that leads to more objectives. The second Roshan attempt will be within 30 to 40 minutes. When teamfighting or pushing objectives, make sure not to waste the Aegis by frontlining and getting caught out of position. The best Aegis usages should result in won teamfights or successful objective pushes.

Rule #3: Don’t save Black King Bar (BKB) in fights
Black King Bar, or BKB, is often the deciding factor between won or lost fights. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve seen carry players save their BKB to try and maximize its efficiency in fights — only to get chain-stunned and bursted down to half health or lower.

It is always suggested to use BKB early in fights to avoid being surprised, stunned, or disabled before being able to use it. If you don’t see your threats that can stun you and you want to jump into a fight, use BKB to start the fight so you don’t get chain-stunned to death.

Note that these tips also apply even if you have Aegis. There’s no point in saving BKB for after dying if your teammates have already died or lost the fight by the time you respawn.

Rule #4: Learn to hard commit and soft commit in fights
Hard commit and soft commit concepts are extremely important for surviving teamfights. Simply staying alive in fights while contributing damage and spells consistently is the key to winning teamfights.

To break down these terms:

Hard commit refers to entering fights knowing you can get out alive. This is mostly when you’re magic immune, such as under BKB or Lifestealer’s Rage. When you’re magic immune, you should really be looking to go all-in, provided there are no BKB-piercing spells like Doom or Legion Commander Duel.

Once you hard commit into fights with BKB, you’ll be given a few seconds to dish out as much damage as possible. After that, you’ll need to keep an eye on the BKB icon and disengage if the fight is not heavily won yet. Overstaying past BKB’s duration is often what gets many carries killed in fights — as they get chain-stunned and bursted after it ends.

Soft commit refers to getting in and out of fights repeatedly while staying alive. I like to see it as floating around fights — almost like a dance. You need to constantly look for openings to engage, disengage, and re-engage without dying. This is usually done with spells and item combinations like Blink Daggers to hop in and out of fights. Every hero has different ways to hard commit and soft commit, so mastering this concept will put you miles ahead in your bracket if you can learn to survive most of your fights while still contributing.

Rule #5: Target squishy heroes or backline supports
Choosing the right heroes to go on in fights is crucial to determining how your fights will go. The majority of the time, you should be looking to target enemy supports as they often have disables, heals, or saves that keep their cores alive. Taking them out early in fights reduces the enemy team's ability to sustain their cores, helping you win fights.

Squishy heroes are also prime targets as they’re easy to burst down — for example, agility cores with low health pools. How you spend the first few seconds of a fight is often the deciding factor. You’re usually only given a small window — often less than 5 seconds — to hard commit using your survivability tools, and then you have to disengage.

Because of this, you must ensure that within those 5 seconds, you eliminate at least one or two enemy heroes. There’s no point engaging the enemy's tanky frontliner and wasting your BKB, which leaves you vulnerable afterward. Sometimes supports may have survivability items like Ghost Scepter to keep themselves alive from your burst. To solve this, selecting the right items to buy is crucial.

Rule #6: Itemize to solve problems
Itemization is complex because every game is different. Each game requires different items to solve different problems. For example, if the enemy team has many disables — like stuns and hexes — then BKB is a must. If enemy supports have defensive items like Eul’s Scepter, Ghost Scepter, or Glimmer Cape, you’ll need Nullifier to deal with them.

Most carries have core items that are the same, but their builds start to differ in the mid to late game. To give you a simpler idea, follow this general itemization formula:

First item — A farming item: Battle Fury, Maelstrom, Mask of Madness.

Second item — A survivability item: BKB, Manta Style, Hurricane Pike, Sange and Yasha.

Third item — A mobility item (if needed): Blink Dagger or Swift Blink.

Next items — Hybrid items combining damage and tankiness: Eye of Skadi, Satanic.

A general rule of thumb: try to have at least 2000 HP by 30 minutes before building pure damage items like Daedalus.

Special Rule: Group together when teammates are pushing
Whenever your teammates are pushing forward, make sure to farm towards them and be near them. This becomes especially important when you hit your item timings — typically around the 20 to 25-minute mark, or earlier if you farm fast.

The most common mistake I see carry players make is the tendency to always split-push and farm jungle camps away from their teammates. Most of the time, when their teammates take a fight, they lose because the carry was slow to react and couldn't join the fight — a behavior known as AFK farming, often done unconsciously.

I’ve heavily covered AFK farming in my latest video, so be sure to check that one out.

A clear sign that you’re contributing frequently and correctly to teamfights is reflected in your post-game hero damage summary. If you’re winning games within 30 to 40 minutes on average with high hero damage, that’s a good sign you’re doing something right.

To summarize, here are the teamfighting rules:

Never frontline without information

Get Aegis before fighting or pushing

Don’t save BKB in fights

Learn to hard commit and soft commit

Target squishy heroes or backline supports

Itemize to solve problems
Special Rule: Group together when your teammates are pushing
